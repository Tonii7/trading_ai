The US30 index has been trending upwards, while the S&P500 and NAS100 have been consolidating. Key levels to watch are 38,000 for US30, 4,200 for S&P500, and 12,400 for NAS100.\n\n**Основной сценарий:**\nFor the NY session, I expect:\n\n* US30 to continue its upward trend, potentially reaching 39,000 if it breaks above the current resistance level.\n* S&P500 to consolidate around the 4,150-4,200 range, with a possibility of breaking out upwards towards 4,250.\n* NAS100 to test the upper end of its consolidation range, potentially reaching 12,600.\n\nThese scenarios are likely to occur if there is no major economic news or events that could disrupt the market.\n\n**Альтернативный сценарий:**\nIf the market goes against our expectations, we may see:\n\n* US30 experiencing a pullback towards 36,500-37,000.\n* S&P500 breaking down below 4,100 and potentially reaching 4,050.\n* NAS100 falling back to its lower consolidation range, around 11,900.\n\nThese alternative scenarios are more likely to occur if there is significant economic news or events that could impact the market.\n\n**План входа/выхода:**\nFor each index:\n\n* US30:\n\t+ Enter long at 38,000 with a stop-loss at 37,500.\n\t+ Exit long at 39,500.\n\t+ Enter short at 36,500 with a stop-loss at 37,000.\n\t+ Exit short at 35,500.\n* S&P500:\n\t+ Enter long at 4,200 with a stop-loss at 4,150.\n\t+ Exit long at 4,300.\n\t+ Enter short at 4,050 with a stop-loss at 4,100.\n\t+ Exit short at 3,950.\n* NAS100:\n\t+ Enter long at 12,400 with a stop-loss at 12,350.\n\t+ Exit long at 12,700.\n\t+ Enter short at 11,900 with a stop-loss at 11,850.\n\t+ Exit short at 11,500.\n\n**Риски и триггеры отмены:**\nTo avoid potential risks and unexpected market movements, we should monitor:\n\n* Any significant economic news or events that could impact the market.\n* Breakouts above or below key levels (38,000 for US30, 4,200 for S&P500, and 12,400 for NAS100).\n* Changes in market sentiment, such as a sudden shift from bullish to bearish.\n\nBy monitoring these factors and adjusting our plan accordingly, we can minimize potential risks and maximize our trading opportunities."}
